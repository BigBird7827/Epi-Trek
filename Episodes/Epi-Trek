McCoy is unsettled when he sees Nancy exactly as she appeared years earlier, while Kirk and Darnell each see a different woman. After Darnell wanders off and is found dead with mysterious marks on his face, the mission turns from routine checkup to potential murder investigation."

The autopsy reveals that Darnell’s body is completely drained of salt. Back on M-113, tensions rise when Crater resists further exams and Nancy’s behavior remains inconsistent. The landing party’s suspicion grows that the Craters may be hiding something about the planet and its dangers."

During the search, the woman who appears as Nancy reveals herself—unseen by the others—to be a shape-shifting creature. It kills another crewman to obtain more salt, assuming his form to escape detection. The creature ultimately makes its way aboard the Enterprise by mimicking someone trusted, taking advantage of the crew’s familiarity and emotions."

Meanwhile, Spock and Kirk piece together the pattern of salt depletion and the victims’ symptoms. Interrogated on the ship, Crater finally admits that his wife died some time ago and that the last surviving native creature of M-113 has been living with him, taking Nancy’s form to keep him company while relying on salt from visiting parties."

The creature, now often appearing as Nancy, becomes increasingly desperate and attacks again, nearly killing more crew to reach salt. In Sickbay, it turns on Kirk, torn between its need to survive and its connection to Crater and McCoy. Spock is forced to strike it repeatedly with a phaser-resistant attack to expose its true form, and McCoy ultimately kills the creature with his phaser to save Kirk. The Enterprise leaves M-113, its last native species now extinct, and Kirk reflects on the tragic necessity of their actions."

Charlie tries to imitate adult behavior he observes but misunderstands boundaries and personal space, especially with Rand.

When a crewman teases him in the gym, Charlie makes the man's legs vanish for a moment and then restores them, treating the act as a lesson rather than an attack. He begins altering reality around him: silencing people, manipulating objects, and making anyone who embarrasses him simply disappear.

After Rand gently rejects his romantic advances, Charlie lashes out and makes her vanish altogether. With fear spreading through the ship, Kirk realizes that conventional force cannot stop Charlie and looks instead for a way to overtax his abilities or appeal to some authority greater than his."

A mysterious alien vessel then appears: a Thasian ship, whose non-corporeal inhabitants gave Charlie his powers so he could survive alone on their harsh world. They restore the Enterprise and her crew to normal and insist that Charlie must return with them because he is too dangerous to live among humans. Charlie pleads desperately to stay, terrified of losing the human contact he has only just discovered, but the Thasians remove him. The Enterprise resumes course, leaving behind a sense of tragic inevitability rather than triumph."
