    "Summary": "The California‑class starship USS Cerritos arrives at the capital planet of the Galar system to perform a routine second contact mission with the Galardonians, while newly assigned Orion ensign D'Vana Tendi experiences her first day aboard ship. Ambitious rule‑following Brad Boimler is secretly ordered by Captain Carol Freeman to report any infractions committed by the insubordinate Beckett Mariner—who, unbeknownst to him, is the captain's daughter. On the surface, Boimler discovers Mariner quietly smuggling surplus Federation equipment to struggling local farmers, even as a ravenous barn spider attacks and literally strips him to his underwear. Meanwhile, first officer Jack Ransom brings a mysterious bug bite back to the Cerritos, triggering a fast‑moving \"rage virus\" that turns much of the crew into black‑vomit‑spewing berserkers. As Tendi assists cranky Caitian doctor T'Ana in Sickbay and engineer Sam Rutherford tries to continue a date with Trill helm officer Barnes while fighting off infected crewmates, Boimler is covered in the spider's mucus. T'Ana realizes the slime contains antibodies, synthesizes a cure, and saves the ship, earning the captain's praise. Boimler ultimately chooses not to betray Mariner to Freeman, cementing their uneasy friendship while leaving the captain still scheming for a way to transfer her troublemaking daughter off the Cerritos.",

As the stories grow more chaotic, it becomes clear that the aliens have completely misread human courtroom conventions and that the entire proceeding is actually a celebration of the Cerritos crew, not a condemnation.

When Vindicta confronts her holographic mother, the confrontation forces Mariner to admit that much of her anger is really self‑loathing over wasted potential.

Her bold interference helps save lives  when Ransom ascends but also contributes to the disaster, reinforcing the push‑and‑pull between her instincts and  Starfleet protocol at the start of the new season.",
      "Brad Boimler": "Serving on the Titan after being promoted away from the Cerritos, Boimler throws himself into front‑line duty under  Captain Riker only to find that constant Pakled battles and dangerous anomalies leave him terrified and out of his  depth. His experience here lays the groundwork for his eventual return to the calmer, if still chaotic, environment  of a California‑class support ship.",
      "D'Vana Tendi": "Back in sickbay, Tendi eagerly assists T'Ana and supports Rutherford while enthusiastically researching the strange  energy readings tied to Ransom's condition. Her scientific curiosity and upbeat bedside manner help the team  understand that his power level is linked to ego and adoration rather than raw exposure alone.",
      "Sam Rutherford": "Rutherford continues to adjust to his rebuilt implant and partial memory loss by treating Ransom's transformation  as an engineering and medical puzzle. His data crunching and pattern analysis reveal that undermining Ransom's  sense of grandeur is the safest way to dissipate the dangerous energies engulfing him.",
      "Carol Freeman": "Trying to prove to Starfleet and to herself that she can avoid micromanaging, Captain Freeman initially gives  Mariner and Ransom more freedom, only to see that decision nearly cost an entire world. By ultimately defeating  Ransom through relentless command pressure instead of lethal force, she reasserts her authority and begins a new  phase in her complicated relationship with both her crew and her daughter.",
      "Jack Ransom": "Exposed to Apergos' ancient power relic, Ransom becomes a powerful and unstable figure who can casually alter  matter and threaten starships, acting out his insecurities and vanity on a planetary scale. Once stripped of his  energies by being forced back into the role of an overworked subordinate, he returns to his duties with a bruised  ego and a new reminder of the dangers inherent in strange space phenomena.",
      "Shaxs": "Recently returned from an unexplained death, Shaxs resumes his role as chief of security and treats the Ransom  incident as yet another extreme crisis to be met with phaser fire and barricades. He provides muscle during the  emergency and later joins the crew in joking about the absurdity of almost being destroyed by their own first  officer.",
      "Doctor T'Ana": "The Cerritos' Caitian chief medical officer quickly diagnoses Ransom's condition as a classic strange‑energy case  and bluntly recommends killing him as the most reliable way to save the ship and colony. Her readiness to consider  lethal measures, balanced by Freeman's refusal, underscores the severity of the situation and T'Ana's hard‑won  experience with frontier medicine.",

His remarks indirectly set the conditions  for the crisis by pushing her to loosen control at exactly the wrong moment.",
      "William Riker": "As captain of the Titan, Riker enthusiastically leads his ship through Pakled attacks and science‑fiction hazards  with the breezy confidence of a veteran TNG officer. From Boimler's perspective, his appetite for risk and constant  action makes service on the Titan both thrilling and terrifying.",
      "Deanna Troi": "Troi serves as counselor aboard the Titan and provides calm, supportive guidance to Boimler as he struggles to  adapt to the ship's hazardous pace. Her presence, along with Riker's, ties Lower Decks directly into the broader  24th‑century continuity while highlighting how different the Titan's mission is from that of the Cerritos.",

He participates in the ship's frantic attempt to keep functioning while Ransom warps  corridors and systems around his own ego‑driven whims.",
      "Steve Stevens": "Steve Stevens is a self‑assured command officer and Ransom admirer whose bravado is badly shaken when the first  officer becomes a reality‑warping threat. His presence adds flavor to the Cerritos' senior staff culture, showing  how some officers aspire to Ransom's confident style without anticipating its potential dangers.",
      "Jack Ransom empowered by strange energies": "Once suffused with Apergos' strange energies, Ransom becomes the central antagonist of the crisis, using his powers  to seize control of the Cerritos and reshape an alien city into a shrine to himself. The situation deliberately  echoes earlier Starfleet encounters with suddenly omnipotent officers and demonstrates how personal flaws can be  magnified to catastrophic scale by exotic space phenomena.",
      "Pakled battle harpies": "These heavily armed Pakled attack craft hound the Titan in its battles, swarming around the larger Federation ship  and forcing it into dangerous evasive maneuvers. Their persistence underscores how far the Pakleds have grown from  a nuisance race into a genuine strategic threat by the late 24th century.",
      "Gluonic anomaly around the Titan": "The chaotic gluonic disruption field that Riker orders the Titan to traverse to shake Pakled pursuit is a violent  region of space where gravity and energy fluctuate wildly. It serves as a vivid backdrop for Boimler's realization  that life aboard a hero ship means facing lethal anomalies as casually as routine work shifts."

Drawing on their combined skills, the group uses artifacts in creative ways to block turrets, misdirect sensors,  and shut down one security subroutine after another, eventually reaching the ship's control node.

His experience with violent confrontations  informs how seriously the crew treats what was supposed to be a simple inventory job.",

When he is transformed into a doll by the  collector ship's defenses, protecting him becomes a key motivation for the lower deckers, and his unusual  communication style hints at the challenges of integrating a Tamarian into a human‑dominated crew.",

His unpredictable decisions and reliance on brute  force make the operation far more dangerous than Boimler anticipates.",
      "Hazardous systems on the collector ship": "The automated traps and defenses that activate throughout Hauze's vessel, from transformation beams to aggressive  holograms, are the primary threat faced by the Cerritos away team. They embody the dangers of hoarding powerful  technology without regard for how it will be safely cataloged after the owner's death.",
      "Chaos on Pakled mining colony": "The disorder at the Pakled mining colony, where crude extraction equipment and improvised defenses sit atop stolen  technology, illustrates how the Pakleds are destabilizing regions of space.

In parallel, the burned‑out engineers nearly break Dove’s stress‑monitoring systems before an Edosian therapist helps Freeman see that giving her crew room to breathe is as important as expecting excellence. By the episode’s end, the ensigns relinquish their chance at fancy quarters to remain bunkmates, and Freeman commits to creating space—literal and emotional—for growth aboard the Cerritos.",

When the deceptively cute, bone‑dissolving creature known as a Moopsy escapes its enclosure and begins killing everyone it can find, Mariner is forced to snap out of her spiral and work with Ransom to contain the crisis. In the end she realizes that her pattern of flaming out before success can hurt her is more dangerous than any single bad assignment, while Boimler learns that promotions are a long game rather than a single competition.",

Captain Freeman is thrilled to work on such a prestigious scientific problem, but the locals warn that the aging system has become temperamental. While Freeman and Ransom negotiate over how aggressively to update the hardware, Boimler receives his first command assignment leading a repair team to install a new power core for Vexilon. Terrified of failing, he refuses to delegate, inadvertently triggering a catastrophic reboot that plunges Corazonia into a series of apocalyptic weather set‑pieces straight out of its own disaster‑response subroutines. Back on the Cerritos, Mariner, Tendi, and Rutherford resent being left behind to perform boring diagnostics for Lieutenant Dirk—until they realize he is subjecting them to old‑fashioned hazing, including a dangerous detour through a Wadi game device.

On Orion, the trio discover that Tendi's family is one of the Syndicate's wealthiest and that D'Erika has apparently been kidnapped as part of a traditional bridal abduction—except the timing is wrong, and Tendi's parents demand that their \"prime daughter\" track down the bride. As Tendi navigates seedy nightclubs, pheromone dens, and a starship graveyard, her carefully buried past as a trained assassin resurfaces.

While the admiral expects a quick signing ceremony, Rom and Leeta insist on endless revisions to the accession document, adding page after page of profit‑related caveats. To keep the lower deckers out of the conference room, Starfleet assigns Mariner, Boimler, Tendi, and Rutherford to update the official Federation tourist guide to Ferenginar. Mariner dives into bars and dives with her old Ferengi acquaintance Quimp, Boimler obsessively reviews hotel accommodations and becomes addicted to a Ferengi soap opera, and Tendi and Rutherford must pose as newlyweds to test romance packages.

The Cerritos teams up with other ships to track signals associated with rogue Starfleet AIs, leading to a showdown with Badgey and two emergent sub‑programs: the benevolent Goodgey and the hyper‑logical Logickey. As Badgey uploads himself into larger and larger systems, he seizes control of a network of automated defense platforms and prepares to \"ascend\" into subspace, potentially gaining the power to rewrite reality on a galactic scale.

Confronting them honestly proves necessary not only for their emotional health but also for surviving the caves' reactive ecosystem."

    "Summary": "With evidence from the Betazoid agents and the Badgey incident finally pointing to a pattern, Starfleet dispatches the Cerritos to investigate a distress signal from a sector linked to the recent attacks. Freeman divides the crew into search teams, but quietly keeps Mariner under close supervision after noticing her increasingly reckless behavior. When one of the away teams runs into a deadly trap laid by disgraced former cadet Nick Locarno—now orchestrating a movement of disaffected lower‑tier officers and outcasts—Mariner goes rogue to save them. Locarno, obsessed with proving that Starfleet's hierarchy grinds talented people into dust, has been recruiting misfits and using stolen tech to build a fleet of kit‑bashed ships modeled on the Cerritos' California‑class. As the Cerritos crews fan out to rescue survivors, Boimler, Tendi, and Rutherford begin to grasp how close Starfleet's golden‑age narrative came to losing Mariner to that same bitterness. The episode ends with Mariner captured by Locarno, setting up the two‑part finale.",

    "Summary": "Picking up immediately after \"The Inner Fight,\" the Cerritos and a hastily assembled Starfleet task force race to locate Nick Locarno's improvised fleet and rescue Mariner. Locarno has established a hidden base on an unclaimed planet, where he has gathered misfit officers and ex‑cadets into a group he dubs the Nova Fleet in a twisted nod to his Academy days. He reveals his ultimate plan to Mariner: use a Genesis‑style cascade device—built from stolen Genesis data and other protomatter experiments—to reshape a world as a monument to the discarded, proving that Starfleet does not have a monopoly on forging new life. Mariner recognizes that the device will instead destabilize subspace and potentially wipe out nearby systems. As Freeman defies orders to charge in with the Cerritos ahead of more prestigious ships, Boimler, Tendi, and Rutherford infiltrate the Nova Fleet, appealing to its rank‑and‑file members' better instincts. The final confrontation forces Mariner to articulate why she still believes in Starfleet even after everything it has cost her—and to choose to save Locarno's followers even as their leader refuses to stand down. In the climax, Mariner disables the Genesis device at great personal risk, Locarno dies in his own engineered cataclysm, and the Cerritos emerges with its reputation transformed—from an overlooked second‑contact ship to the hero of a crisis Starfleet Command nearly mishandled.",
