Over Vulcan objections, Archer assembles his crew, accepts Vulcan science officer T'Pol and Denobulan doctor Phlox aboard, and takes Enterprise on its maiden voyage to deliver Klaang and investigate why the Suliban want him.",

    "Summary": "After an away mission mishap, Archer and Trip awaken inside what appears to be a prison complex run by the Tandarans, a species allied with the Vulcans. They discover that the facility is actually an internment camp holding hundreds of Suliban, many of whom insist they are innocent civilians rather than members of the Cabal. Colonel Grat, the camp's commander, defends the detentions as necessary security during the Temporal Cold War. As Archer learns more about the internees and witnesses abuses, he becomes determined to help expose the injustice and aid a Suliban escape, even at the cost of angering a potential ally.",

When the cybernetic corpses revive as Borg drones and assimilate the scientists and their ship, Enterprise is dispatched to intercept the runaway vessel. As Phlox becomes infected by nanoprobes during an autopsy, Archer struggles to grasp the nature of an enemy bent on turning all life into machinery. The crew must stop the assimilated transport before it can send a signal that will eventually draw the full Borg Collective toward Earth centuries earlier than history records.",

    ],
    "Summary": "Enterprise is battered by violent gravimetric distortions that twist corridors, crush bulkheads and randomly erase matter, leaving the crew shaken and systems failing. While repairing the damage, the ship is raided by Osaarian pirates who exploit the anomalies to ambush and loot vessels drifting through the Expanse. When critical supplies are stolen, Archer pursues the raiders to a concealed base hidden within the debris of a mysterious artificial sphere. There he recovers data that may explain the Expanse's bizarre physics, but only after resorting to brutal tactics against a captured pirate—further blurring the line between justice and vengeance.",
