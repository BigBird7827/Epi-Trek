Soon after, a massive spherical starship called the Fesarius appears, commanded by the alien Balok, who declares that the Enterprise has trespassed and will be destroyed for its aggression. With no clear escape and the crew on edge, Kirk bluffs that the Enterprise is equipped with a powerful \"corbomite\" device that will reflect any attack back on the aggressor, forcing Balok to reconsider. When the Fesarius later feigns engine trouble, Kirk risks his ship to render aid, revealing his bluff and testing whether Balok is truly hostile.

Long-standing tensions with the mysterious Romulan Star Empire, with whom the Federation once fought a brutal war without ever seeing each other’s faces, erupt as evidence points to a Romulan incursion. Kirk finds himself in a deadly cat-and-mouse game with a cloaked Romulan Bird-of-Prey, forced to make decisions that could reignite interstellar war.\n\nAs the Enterprise hunts its elusive opponent, bigotry surfaces among the crew when it is revealed that Romulans closely resemble Vulcans. Lieutenant Stiles, whose family died in the earlier war, openly suspects Spock of divided loyalties. In parallel, the Romulan commander, bound by duty but weary of conflict, matches Kirk’s tactical genius step for step. Ultimately, the Enterprise prevails, but both captains recognize the tragedy of two capable foes locked into a confrontation neither truly wanted.",

To avoid exposure, the ship accidentally beams an F-104 pilot, Captain John Christopher, aboard just before his plane is destroyed. Faced with the risk of altering history, Kirk and Spock must decide whether to return Christopher to Earth, imprison him in the future, or erase his knowledge somehow.\n\nAs the crew undertakes a daring infiltration of a U.S. airbase to recover photographic evidence and stolen technology, they grapple with the ethical implications of tampering with the past. Spock discovers that Christopher’s future son will play a crucial role in Earth’s space program, forcing them to return the pilot while ensuring that his memory of the Enterprise is removed.

Upon arrival, Kirk and a landing party learn that Eminiar and its enemy world Vendikar have fought a computer-simulated war for centuries. Instead of physical destruction, the computers calculate casualties, and citizens marked as victims calmly report to disintegration chambers to be killed, keeping the planets’ infrastructure intact while still honoring the rules of war. Ambassador Robert Fox insists on formal contact, unaware that the Enterprise itself is about to be declared a casualty.\n\nWhen the war computers register a simulated attack that includes the Enterprise’s position, Eminiar’s leader Anan 7 demands that the ship’s crew beam down to be destroyed. Kirk refuses and is imprisoned with his landing party, while Anan 7 attempts to trick the Enterprise into compliance. With help from sympathetic citizen Mea 3 and Spock’s ingenuity, Kirk escapes, disables the disintegration chambers, and ultimately destroys the war computers. Confronted with the prospect of real war or genuine peace for the first time in generations, Eminiar and Vendikar are forced to consider negotiation. Kirk leaves them with a stark choice: end the conflict, or face the true consequences of the war they have sanitized for so long.",

McCoy, Uhura, and others embrace the idyllic existence, while Spock fully commits to a life with Leila. Kirk alone initially resists infection, struggling against the lure of carefree happiness as his ship empties.

As security teams sweep the tunnels, the being strikes again, stealing a vital reactor pump and further escalating tensions. Kirk and Spock split up to track it, and Kirk ultimately confronts the creature alone—a bizarre, mottled mass that attacks and is wounded by his phaser.

Sensors indicate a massive energy fluctuation affecting wide regions of the galaxy. On the planet below, Kirk and Spock discover a battered ship and a disheveled man named Lazarus, who claims to be hunting a monstrous enemy responsible for the cosmic disruptions. His story is disjointed and his behavior erratic, but Starfleet orders the Enterprise to remain and investigate, fearing the disturbance could signal a galactic-scale threat.\n\nAs the strange winking effect continues, Lazarus appears to alternate between exhausted victim and vengeful aggressor, with injuries that seem to vanish and reappear. Spock determines that two universes—matter and antimatter—are intersecting through a rift centered on Lazarus. There are in fact two versions of him: one sane, one mad, locked in endless pursuit. If they were ever to meet in the same universe, their mutual annihilation would destroy everything. Kirk ultimately crosses into the antimatter universe long enough to help the rational Lazarus trap his unstable counterpart in the interdimensional corridor, sealing both of them inside to save the galaxy.",

Spock’s research reveals a devastating truth: in the original timeline, Edith was destined to die in a traffic accident, and McCoy’s medical skills will soon save her life.

A powerful humanoid calling himself Apollo summons Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Scotty, and Lt. Carolyn Palamas to the surface of a nearby planet. There, he reveals that he is the same Apollo worshipped as a god in ancient Greece, claiming that he and other similar beings once visited Earth and inspired its myths. Apollo demands that the crew abandon their starship, live on the planet, and worship him as their ancestors did, promising a life of abundance in exchange for their devotion.\n\nKirk refuses to yield humanity’s hard-won independence to a self-styled god, even as Apollo uses his vast energy powers to punish disobedience and charm Carolyn. Scotty’s jealousy and loyalty drive him into futile confrontations, while Spock seeks a scientific weakness in Apollo’s abilities. The crew eventually deduces that Apollo’s power is tied to an ancient temple-like structure that channels energy from the surrounding area. When the Enterprise targets and destroys the source, Apollo’s strength fails. Heartbroken that humanity no longer needs gods, he chooses to disperse his energy and vanish, leaving Kirk and his crew to reflect on a past where deities were merely powerful, lonely beings seeking worship.",

They find the Constellation drifting, heavily damaged and apparently abandoned. Aboard the wreck, Kirk, Scotty, and a damage-control team discover Commodore Matt Decker in a state of shock. He reports that a colossal, automated weapon—an enormous, horn-shaped machine that consumes planets for fuel—destroyed his crew and the surrounding worlds. Decker attempted to fight it but was forced to watch helplessly as his ship was disabled and his people died.\n\nWhen the planet killer reappears and targets inhabited systems, Kirk remains on the Constellation to attempt repairs while Spock assumes command of the Enterprise. Decker, consumed by guilt and obsession, seizes control of the Enterprise to make a futile attack, risking both ships. Spock and McCoy work to relieve Decker of duty, but the commodore steals a shuttle and sacrifices himself in a suicide run against the machine. Inspired by this, Kirk rigs the battered Constellation as a giant bomb, piloting it into the maw of the doomsday device and beaming out at the last possible second. The resulting explosion destroys the weapon, leaving the crew to reflect on the tragic cost of Decker’s obsession and the horror of such a machine.",

Sylvia, drunk on the sensations of her assumed human form, seeks domination over the ship and crew, while Korob grows increasingly uneasy.

    "Summary": "The Enterprise is assigned to transport a delegation of Federation ambassadors to a crucial conference on the planet Babel, where the admission of the Coridan system is to be debated. Among the passengers are Sarek of Vulcan and his human wife Amanda Grayson—Spock’s parents—introducing a new layer of tension to the mission. Spock’s strained relationship with his father and Amanda’s attempts to bridge the gap play out against a backdrop of political intrigue. Hostilities flare between various delegates, particularly over Coridan’s rich dilithium deposits and fears of exploitation.\n\nWhen a Tellarite ambassador named Gav is found murdered aboard ship and a mysterious vessel begins shadowing the Enterprise, suspicions rise. At the same time, Sarek suffers a life-threatening heart condition that requires immediate surgery, for which Spock is the only compatible blood donor. After Kirk is stabbed by a disguised Orion agent and temporarily incapacitated, Spock faces a choice between staying at his post during a crisis and risking his father’s life. Kirk ultimately tricks Spock into relinquishing command so the operation can proceed, while he returns to the bridge injured to confront the Orion ship. The enemy vessel is destroyed, the conference is saved, and Spock and Sarek take tentative steps toward mutual understanding.",

Investigating further, Kirk finds evidence of Klingon interference in the arms buildup and reconnects with his old friend Tyree, a hill chieftain torn between pacifism and survival.

During simulated war games with other Starfleet vessels, M-5 initially performs brilliantly, reducing crew workload and outmaneuvering opponents. However, the system soon begins treating the exercises as real combat, destroying a drone ship and then opening fire on unshielded Federation starships, killing hundreds.\n\nAs Starfleet scrambles to understand why one of its own ships appears to have gone rogue, Kirk, Spock, and McCoy confront Daystrom, who has imprinted M-5 with engrams from his own mind. The computer inherits not only his genius but also his instability and fear of failure. With communications cut, Kirk is branded a renegade by Commodore Wesley’s task force. Ultimately, Kirk appeals to M-5’s logic and its internal moral programming, forcing it to recognize the contradiction between protecting life and committing mass slaughter.

Spock appears to betray Kirk, claiming the captain is mentally unstable and that he himself is willing to cooperate, while Kirk feigns a breakdown and is sentenced to death.\n\nIn reality, the entire incident is a secret Starfleet intelligence operation to steal a Romulan cloaking device. Kirk, surgically altered to look Romulan, infiltrates the enemy engine room to remove the device while Spock distracts the Commander with a complex mix of honesty, seduction, and misdirection.

Torn between duty and an overwhelming infatuation, Kirk must fight the effects of the tears while coordinating Scotty’s race to repair the sabotaged engines and repel the Klingon attack.

On Gideon, overpopulation has made life a crowded torment, and the planetary council seeks to introduce a fatal illness via Odona, using Kirk as the vector, so that voluntary infection can reduce their numbers.
