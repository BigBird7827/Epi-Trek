    "Summary": "The Enterprise arrives at planet M-113 for routine medical examinations of Professor Robert Crater and his wife Nancy, an old flame of Dr. McCoy. Soon after the landing party beams down, crewmen begin turning up dead with all salt drained from their bodies, and Crater\u2019s evasive behavior raises Kirk\u2019s suspicions. As the deaths spread from the planet to the ship, Kirk and Spock uncover that Nancy died years earlier and that a shape-shifting native creature has been living with Crater, impersonating her to obtain salt. In a final confrontation in sickbay, the creature reveals its true, desperate nature even as it attacks the crew, forcing McCoy to kill the last of its species. The tragedy underscores the painful limits of Starfleet\u2019s compassion when a unique lifeform\u2019s survival is fundamentally incompatible with the safety of the crew.",

Nancy leads Darnell away from the others, and moments later a scream rings out from the ruins, drawing Kirk and McCoy to the disturbing sight of Darnell\u2019s corpse on the ground."

As Charlie\u2019s infatuation with Yeoman Rand curdles into possessiveness, his immense psychic powers begin to warp reality aboard ship, turning crewmates into playthings for his childish temper.

Even Spock falls under the spores\u2019 influence, experiencing romantic fulfillment with former colleague Leila Kalomi and reveling in emotions he usually suppresses. As the crew drifts toward permanent desertion, Kirk must fight off the spores\u2019 seductive peace, provoke Spock into anger to free him, and ultimately force the colonists and his officers to confront the painful but necessary demands of real, unsanitized life.",

When Spock is infected during an attack, he battles to maintain control of his mind while McCoy and Kirk search for a way to destroy the parasites without exterminating their human hosts.

Kirk, Spock, and McCoy are quickly drawn into a turf war between rival bosses Bela Oxmyx and Jojo Krako, both eager to use Federation technology to gain an edge. To restore some semblance of order, Kirk adopts the language and style of a mob boss, declaring the Federation the new \"top boss\" and forcing the gangs into a protection-racket version of planetary government. The operation underscores the perils of cultural interference and the uncomfortable compromises required to stabilize a society warped by a careless glimpse of Earth\u2019s past.",

Suspicious of his motives and skeptical of his story, Kirk detains Seven, only for him to escape to the surface with a shape-shifting cat companion and unwitting secretary Roberta Lincoln. As Seven moves to sabotage an orbital nuclear platform in order to prevent a future arms catastrophe, the Enterprise crew must decide whether to stop him or help him, knowing any interference could alter history. In the end, they reluctantly aid his mission, recognizing that his actions were always part of the original timeline, and depart with the uneasy understanding that other guardians may be quietly shaping Earth\u2019s past.",

Kirk leads a boarding party and is nearly lost when the Defiant fades out of phase; a transporter glitch leaves him trapped in interspace, presumed dead. As Spock assumes command and confronts both mounting crew stress and the arrival of hostile Tholian ships weaving an energy web around the Enterprise, he must balance loyalty to Kirk with the demands of survival. Guided by Kirk\u2019s pre-recorded orders and McCoy\u2019s prickly counsel, the crew holds together long enough to recover their captain from the shifting interphase, escaping the completed Tholian web and leaving behind a region of space best avoided.",

        "Text": "Hearing screams and sounds of conflict beyond the library, Kirk rushes through an atavachron portal and finds himself in a pre-industrial village where he is quickly accused of witchcraft for his strange clothes and communicator. When Spock and McCoy follow, they are inadvertently sent through a different portal to a far-distant ice age, materializing in a frozen wasteland with no apparent way back. On the hot, medieval-like world, Kirk tries to convince suspicious locals he is not a demon, while in the ice age, Spock and McCoy struggle against lethal cold and dwindling supplies."

She has adapted to her harsh environment and resigns herself to permanent isolation, at first viewing the newcomers with skepticism. Spock, affected by the temporal environment, begins to exhibit more primal Vulcan traits: his logical control weakens, emotions surface more readily, and he finds himself drawn to Zarabeth in a way that surprises both him and McCoy. Meanwhile, Kirk in the feudal era is jailed and interrogated by authorities who see his talk of stars and ships as heresy."

Spock\u2019s growing emotional bond with Zarabeth leads him to contemplate staying with her permanently, abandoning any attempt to return to the Enterprise. McCoy, terrified of freezing to death and losing his friend to regression, insists they must attempt a return path, arguing that Zarabeth\u2019s information about the atavachron may be inaccurate or incomplete. On Sarpeidon\u2019s feudal past, Kirk manages to convince a sympathetic woman and her noble patron that he is not an agent of the devil, eventually coercing them into helping him find the doorway back to the library."

Spock, torn between duty and his feelings for Zarabeth, learns that she cannot accompany them; the atavachron\u2019s conditioning means she would die if removed from her assigned time.

    "Summary": "Responding to a distress call from a scientific expedition on Camus II, the Enterprise crew finds Dr. Janice Lester, an old flame of Kirk\u2019s, apparently dying and embittered over Starfleet\u2019s restrictions on her career. Using an alien mind-transfer device in a moment of privacy, she swaps consciousness with Kirk, seizing his body and command while trapping his mind in her own weakened form. Back on the ship, \"Kirk\" begins issuing erratic, vindictive orders that unsettle the crew, even as the real Kirk\u2014now in Lester\u2019s body\u2014struggles to convince Spock and others of the truth. Aboard a ship where loyalty to the captain is paramount, officers must risk mutiny to stop a commander who is not what he seems, ultimately restoring minds to their rightful bodies and reaffirming the responsibilities that come with the captain\u2019s chair.",

Lester, once romantically involved with Kirk, lies on a bed, furious at the universe and Starfleet for thwarting her ambitions. When she and Kirk are briefly left alone in a chamber housing alien technology, she activates a concealed device that immobilizes them both and swaps their consciousnesses between bodies."

Dr. Coleman, in league with Lester, declares that she is too fragile to be moved, while \"Kirk\" orders her transported aboard under medical care. Back on the Enterprise, \"Kirk\" resumes command but soon exhibits uncharacteristic pettiness, paranoia, and emotional volatility, especially toward female officers and those who question him.

A mind meld with Lester\u2019s body reveals Kirk\u2019s familiar thoughts and memories, convincing Spock that a transfer has indeed occurred.

The crew refuses to carry out an execution order, effectively staging a mutiny.
