    "Summary": "While exploring the very edge of the galaxy, the Enterprise is dragged into the crushing gravity well of a dead star and trapped in a decaying orbit. There they discover a gigantic, ancient alien pod ship whose insectoid builders apparently destroyed themselves to contain a dangerous force. Kirk leads an away team to investigate and learns that a malevolent, bodiless entity once tried to seize the pod ship, forcing its crew to sacrifice themselves rather than let it escape.\n\nWhen the entity transfers itself to the Enterprise and begins sabotaging systems, Kirk must outthink a foe that can move at computer speed and inhabit the ship’s circuitry. By feigning surrender and then jettisoning the Enterprise free of the dead star, Kirk leaves the entity behind in a powerless husk, stranded once more in the star’s grip. The Enterprise escapes with new respect for the unknown dangers lurking at the galaxy’s farthest rim.",

He guides young Spock through the dangerous kahs-wan ordeal, confronts a deadly le-matya, and helps the boy choose logic over emotion when their beloved sehlat I-Chaya is mortally wounded.

Both ships are suddenly pulled into a strange temporal distortion and emerge in Elysia, a pocket universe filled with vessels and crews from many different worlds and eras who have been trapped for centuries. The Elysian Council has forged a fragile peace among former enemies, and they insist that the Enterprise and Klingons maintain that truce if they wish to stay.\n\nKirk, unwilling to accept permanent exile, works with Spock and Scotty to analyze the distortion and search for a way out. When the Klingons secretly plant an explosive aboard the Enterprise in an attempt to seize the only chance of escape, their plan threatens everyone in Elysia. By exposing the sabotage and forcing a brief alliance, Kirk uses the combined power of both ships to slip back through the time rift, proving that cooperation is the only way to escape the trap.",

A sudden seaquake capsizes the craft and Kirk and Spock disappear, only to be found later transformed into water-breathers with gills and webbed features. McCoy determines that an unknown factor in the planet’s seas has permanently altered their physiology, leaving them unable to breathe air.\n\nSeeking answers, the group discovers the Aquans, an evolved society of former surface-dwelling humanoids who now live beneath the sea and regard air-breathers as barbaric. While younger Aquans like Rila sympathize with the strangers, conservative leaders such as Secondus argue that Kirk and Spock should be exiled or executed.
