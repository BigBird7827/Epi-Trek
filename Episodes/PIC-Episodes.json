In the aftermath, the Titan-A is rechristened the Enterprise-G under Captain Seven of Nine, with Raffi as her first officer and Jack serving in a special advisory role. In a final coda, Picard joins his old friends for one last poker game, their story closing on laughter, shared memory, and the sense that while this may be the last generation of this crew, their legacy will continue to echo through the stars."
