Dal’s failed attempt to flee brands him a troublemaker, yet it also brings him into contact with a hulking young miner called Rok-Tahk and the enigmatic Medusan Zero, a non-corporeal being who has already escaped the Diviner once and now manipulates its containment suit to help others. When Dal is sent to search the deep caverns for a rumored \"Unwanted\" prisoner, he instead discovers the buried Starfleet starship USS Protostar, and realizes that the key to freedom may not be a tunnel out of the colony but a ship that can take them far beyond it.",

    "Summary": "Responding to a distress signal, the Protostar crew discovers a planet populated by aliens who have modeled their entire culture on half-understood stories of an old Starfleet officer, turning \"Starflight\" into a kind of cargo-cult religion. Calling themselves Enderprizians, they dress in crude approximations of Starfleet uniforms and reenact garbled versions of classic missions, unknowingly perpetuating dangerous misunderstandings. Dal and the crew must gently correct the myths, address a looming environmental disaster threatening the settlement, and decide how much interference is appropriate when a society has built its identity around mistaken ideas of Starfleet.",

    "Summary": "Seeking a break from constant pressure, the crew retreats to the holodeck for a series of lighthearted adventures tailored to each of their tastes. However, the simulations begin to glitch and trap them, morphing into a labyrinth of connected programs with no obvious exit. As the kids search for the source of the malfunction, they gradually discover that Hologram Janeway has been secretly altered by the Protostar’s weapon, turning her into an unwitting agent trying to steer them toward Starfleet—and thus toward catastrophe. Heartbroken, the crew must confront the mentor they trusted most and find a way to restore her true self while preventing the weapon from using her again.",

Officially, their first assignment is to study the unstable wormhole left behind by the destruction of the Protostar and to learn the ropes as warrant officers. Unofficially, Janeway carries a secret objective: to find the lost Captain Chakotay and uncover what truly happened on Solum. As the young crew chafes under drills and simulations—especially Dal, who longs to leap back into action—they begin to suspect that their new mission is far more dangerous and personal than any standard training cruise.",

As Janeway and her officers sift through contradictory logs, the kids struggle to explain what they did in a future that technically no longer exists. When a cryptic recording from a future version of Murf surfaces, hinting at the location of the lost Protostar and a lingering threat to Gwyn, the crew must decide whether to defy orders again to chase the lead. Their every move risks creating new paradoxes, turning them into both observers and catalysts of their own history.",

It embodies the season's ultimate no-win scenario, forcing the crew to risk everything to sew shut the wound in time they helped create.",
      "Rok-Tahk": "Rok-Tahk is the gentle giant of the crew, a brilliant young scientist and engineer who once thought of herself only as muscle.

    "Summary": "Deep inside Ouroboros, the Protostar crew must coordinate with Wesley, Janeway, and allies on the outside to close the loop without destroying Solum or the Federation. Asencia launches a last-ditch assault on both the temporal structure and Solum's surface, gambling that any outcome that humiliates the Federation will justify her crusade. The cadets execute a daring plan to send the Protostar back along a carefully sculpted path, sewing shut the temporal wound they helped create and depriving the Loom of its foothold. When the storm clears, Solum and the Federation are left with scars and new possibilities, while the young officers step into the next phase of their lives.",

      {
        "Header": "Teaser",
        "Text": "In the luminous void of Ouroboros, the Protostar encounters echoes of itself at different points along its journey, some intact, some destroyed. Zero realizes that their path through the loop must harmonize these conflicting possibilities into a single stable outcome or risk fracturing reality even further."
      },
      {
        "Header": "Act I",
        "Text": "Working from the edge of the storm, Wesley and the Travellers coordinate with Janeway to feed precise corrective pulses into Ouroboros, giving the Protostar signposts to follow. Inside, Rok and Jankom push the engines to their limits while keeping the ship's hull from tearing apart under overlapping gravities. Dal distributes command responsibilities with a confidence that shows how far he has come from the uncertain runaway of Season 1."
      },
      {
        "Header": "Act II",
        "Text": "Asencia uses stolen Traveller data to punch a corridor of her own into Ouroboros, intending to seize control of the loop before the Federation can stabilize it. She confronts the cadets directly, arguing that their efforts will only preserve a timeline in which Solum suffered because the Federation intervened imperfectly. Gwyn counters that the answer is not erasing pain but building a future that learns from it, offering Asencia a chance to stand down."
      },
      {
        "Header": "Act III",
        "Text": "Refusing, Asencia turns her weapons on both the Protostar and the Loom-infused strands around them, causing Ouroboros to convulse violently. Wesley and Zero improvise a new solution: sending a carefully tuned echo of the Protostar back to the key branching point that first drew the Loom's attention, effectively stitching the loop closed from both ends. The maneuver risks trapping part of their own experience in the loop forever."
      },
      {
        "Header": "Act IV",
        "Text": "The plan works: energy levels in Ouroboros plummet as the loop stabilizes into a harmless ring of dormant subspace, severing the Loom's connection to this region. Asencia is pulled into the collapsing structure, her ultimate fate left ambiguous amid the fading light. The Protostar emerges battered but intact, greeted by cheers from Voyager-A and a quiet sense of relief from Solum's war-weary populace."

        "Text": "In the aftermath, diplomatic talks between Solum and the Federation tentatively begin, bolstered by Ilthuran's testimony and Gwyn's willingness to serve as a bridge between cultures. The cadets are formally recognized as warrant officers with the option to continue their studies or pursue new assignments, and Dal is invited to chart a path toward eventual captaincy. Janeway records one last log about a future that remains unwritten, trusting that the young crew who faced the Loom will help shape it for the better."
