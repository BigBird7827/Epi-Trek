# Star Trek Episode Companion

This project is a static, browser-based Star Trek episode companion.

The included `index.html` file:
- Loads a single episode record from JSON embedded in a `<script>` block.
- Displays core metadata (series, season, episode, ID, stardate/year, production code, air date).
- Shows a one-line summary of the episode.
- Breaks the story into sections (Teaser, Act One, Act Two, Act Three, Act Four).
- Lists key characters, guest characters, and antagonists as labeled chips.
- Lists ethical issues raised by the episode.
- Shows continuity notes, thematic notes, and behind-the-scenes notes as small info cards.

Everything is done with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is suitable for hosting on GitHub Pages or any static web host.
